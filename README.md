# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
I was given the provided code with the purpose of going through and refactoring it so that it could meet the criteria laid out by the client. In this case, the primary objective was to improve the overall accessibility standards of the site. This assignment was made all the more possible thanks to the acceptance criteria that was included in the original README file found in the downloaded content. This criteria will be included later on in this file alongside the given User Story. 
 
When first viewing the code the primary thing that I did was to replace 'div' tags with the appropriate semantic elements and altered the css to work with these changes. I continued my work by cleaning up the given code by orgnizing the css by grouping similar selectors and provided comments to better distinguish the content. I then went into actually fixing the html in order to improve accessibility. This was accomplished by fixing missing links and by providing the necessary alt text for images and icons.
 
It is worthy of noting that due to the inclusion of the 'hero' image in the css file, the addiction of 'alt' text was not easily possible given the tools at my disposal. With the permission and encouragement of my instructors this image was moved to the html file and the appropriate css code was added or removed in order to preserve the desired placement of the image.
